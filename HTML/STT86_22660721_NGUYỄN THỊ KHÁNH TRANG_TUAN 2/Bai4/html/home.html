                        Scrapbook albums have existed since the beginning of photography.However,the sad fact is that photographs and mot printed aterial are not permanent:they will fade and yellow with age.Scrapbookers of today are aware of these problems,and the industry is
                        providing remedies to minimize deterioration.For the best results,avoidusing materials with high acid content which can cause photos and paper to deteriorate.Another thing to avoid is lignin,a material that is the boding element
                        in wood fibers.Over time,paper with ligin will become yellow and brittle, so you should only use lignin-free products.

                    <p>
                        Your albus should contain page protectors to shield the pages from smudges,oil,and dirt that can be transferred from your hands.You should never use albums with sticky "magnetic" pages.The sticky substance will be transferred to the photo and backing
                        paper causing deterioration.Never crop Polaroid Â® photos:they will curl and fall apart.Mount all memorabilia on acid-free cardstock paper,and photocopy all newspaper clipping on acid-free paper
